SUBJECT: Request for Service Quota Increase - G Instances

Hi AWS Support Team,

I am working on an AI research project using ComfyUI for image generation.
I have successfully secured AWS Credits for this project and I am trying to launch a 'g4dn.xlarge' instance in us-east-1.

However, I am receiving a "Launch Failed" error because my account seems to have a vCPU quota of 0 for G instances.

Could you please increase my quota for "Running On-Demand G instances" (L-DB2E81BA) in the US East (N. Virginia) region?

Requested Quota: 8 vCPUs (enough for 2x g4dn.xlarge or 1x g4dn.2xlarge)

Use Case: Running open-source AI models (Stable Diffusion) for a content automation pipeline.

Thank you!
